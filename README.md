# Assembla-Standup
Python script to file your daily standup on assembla. It saves you the hassle of remembering what you need to do today. Checks the current cardwall condition and fills in your standup with which tickets you are currently working on, which tickets are assigned to your for review and which tickets you'll pick up next. All you need is to have your cardwall up to date.

Wrote it at my first job as part of automating all the automatable tasks. Works like a charm once setup.

You need to add authentication fields in this script (see Fill in the blanks section) to start using this script.
